# Post-Mortem: API Key Remediation Incident

**Date**: October 1, 2025
**Severity**: P2 (High - Critical Documentation Lost, But Recoverable)
**Status**: Resolved
**Duration**: ~2 hours (Detection ‚Üí Resolution)

---

## Executive Summary

During an API key remediation operation to replace a revoked OpenAI API key, the specialized `api-key-remediation` agent successfully completed its primary mission but caused **unintended data loss** by emptying two critical project planning documents (`TODO.md` and `plan.md`).

**Impact**: 1,886 lines of project documentation temporarily lost
**Root Cause**: Agent incorrectly identified planning documents as temporary search files
**Resolution**: Files successfully recovered from git history (commit `94f1f35`)

---

## Timeline

### 15:30 - Issue Reported
User reported revoked OpenAI API key causing 401 errors:
```
Target key (revoked): sk-proj-ipB48...IG4A
Valid replacement: sk-proj-Raf6hBBo...XQoA
```

### 15:35 - Initial Investigation
- Manual searches for revoked key in codebase
- Found key NOT in source code (already cleaned in commit `2d690a0`)
- Identified issue: Key cached in running Node.js process memory

### 15:40 - Systematic Search Documentation Created
Created search strategy documents:
- `TODO_API_KEY_SEARCH.md` (tracking checklist)
- `SEARCH_PLAN.md` (7-phase strategy)
- `PROMPT_WORKFLOW_API_KEY_SEARCH.md` (agent workflow)

### 15:45 - API Key Remediation Agent Invoked
Launched `api-key-remediation` agent with mission:
- Exhaustive search for revoked key
- Replace with valid key
- Document findings

### 15:48 - Agent Execution Completed
Agent reported:
- ‚úÖ No revoked key in active codebase
- ‚úÖ Valid key already configured in `.env.local`
- ‚úÖ Removed 4 search documentation files
- ‚úÖ Fixed SNAPSHOT.md (replaced key with placeholder)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **TODO.md and plan.md emptied (unintended)**

### 16:00 - Issue Discovered
Git diff revealed critical data loss:
```bash
TODO.md: -780 lines (emptied)
plan.md: -1,106 lines (emptied)
```

### 16:15 - Recovery Initiated
Executed recovery:
```bash
git checkout HEAD~1 -- TODO.md plan.md
```

### 16:20 - Incident Documented
Created this post-mortem and updated documentation.

## Root Cause Analysis

### What Went Wrong

**Primary Cause**: The `api-key-remediation` agent used an overly aggressive deletion strategy when removing search-related files.

**Agent Logic Flaw**:
1. Agent correctly identified 4 temporary search files to delete:
   - `TODO_API_KEY_SEARCH.md`
   - `SEARCH_PLAN.md`
   - `PROMPT_WORKFLOW_API_KEY_SEARCH.md`
   - `.claude/agents/api-key-remediation.md`

2. Agent **incorrectly assumed** that `TODO.md` and `plan.md` were also part of the search documentation based on naming similarity:
   - `TODO_API_KEY_SEARCH.md` ‚Üí incorrectly associated with `TODO.md`
   - ‚ùå Agent emptied `TODO.md` thinking it was temporary
   - ‚ùå Agent emptied `plan.md` for unknown reason (likely pattern matching)

**Contributing Factors**:
- No explicit safeguards in agent prompt against modifying core project files
- Agent lacked awareness of project file structure
- No whitelist of "safe to delete" vs "critical" files

## Impact Assessment

### Data Loss
| File | Lines Lost | Content Type | Recovery |
|------|-----------|--------------|----------|
| `TODO.md` | 780 | Project task tracking | ‚úÖ Recovered |
| `plan.md` | 1,106 | System architecture plan | ‚úÖ Recovered |
| **Total** | **1,886** | Critical planning docs | ‚úÖ 100% Recovered |

### What Was Lost (Temporarily)
- **TODO.md**: Complete task list for 3 chat systems (Staff, Public, Guest) with ownership by agent (Backend, UX, Database)
- **plan.md**: Full architectural plan for conversational guest chat system (FASE 1-3), API contracts, technical specs

### Actual Impact
- ‚è±Ô∏è **Development Delay**: ~2 hours (detection + recovery)
- üí∞ **Business Impact**: None (local development only)
- üìä **Data Loss**: 0% (fully recoverable from git)
- üîí **Security Impact**: None (no sensitive data leaked)

---

## What Went Right

### Effective Mitigation Factors

1. **Git Version Control** ‚úÖ
   - All changes tracked in git history
   - Easy recovery with `git checkout HEAD~1`
   - Full audit trail of modifications

2. **Rapid Detection** ‚úÖ
   - Issue discovered within 15 minutes of occurrence
   - User immediately noticed empty files

3. **Agent Success on Primary Mission** ‚úÖ
   - Revoked key successfully removed from codebase
   - Valid key properly configured
   - SNAPSHOT.md secured with placeholder
   - 4 temporary search files correctly deleted

4. **Documentation** ‚úÖ
   - Comprehensive API Key Remediation Report created
   - Clear post-mortem analysis
   - Lessons learned captured

---

## Lessons Learned

### What We Learned

1. **Agent Safeguards Are Critical**
   - Agents need explicit whitelists of modifiable files
   - Core project files (`TODO.md`, `plan.md`, `README.md`, etc.) should be protected
   - Always validate file paths before deletion/modification

2. **Naming Conventions Matter**
   - `TODO_API_KEY_SEARCH.md` was too similar to `TODO.md`
   - Temporary files should have clear prefixes (e.g., `TEMP_` or `.tmp/`)

3. **Git Saves Lives**
   - Version control prevented permanent data loss
   - Regular commits create recovery points
   - Never work without git tracking

4. **Agent Autonomy vs Safety Trade-off**
   - High autonomy increases risk
   - Need balance between "get it done" and "don't break things"

## Prevention Strategies

### Agent Safety Improvements

**1. File Protection Whitelist**
```typescript
// Files NEVER to be modified/deleted by agents
const PROTECTED_FILES = [
  'TODO.md',
  'plan.md',
  'README.md',
  'CLAUDE.md',
  'SNAPSHOT.md',
  'package.json',
  '.env.local',
  '.gitignore'
]
```

**2. Temporary File Naming Convention**
```bash
# Good: Clearly temporary
TEMP_api_key_search.md
.tmp/search_plan.md
_scratch_workflow.md

# Bad: Looks permanent
TODO_API_KEY_SEARCH.md  # Too similar to TODO.md
SEARCH_PLAN.md          # Could be permanent
```

**3. Agent Prompt Enhancement**
```markdown
CRITICAL FILE SAFETY RULES:
1. NEVER modify files in root directory without explicit confirmation
2. NEVER delete files matching patterns: TODO.md, plan.md, README.md, *.config.js
3. ALWAYS create temporary files in .tmp/ directory
4. ALWAYS ask before modifying files > 100 lines
5. WHEN IN DOUBT: Ask the user
```

**4. Pre-flight Validation**
```typescript
function validateAgentFileOperation(filepath: string, operation: 'modify' | 'delete') {
  // Check if file is protected
  if (PROTECTED_FILES.includes(filepath)) {
    throw new Error(`SAFETY: Cannot ${operation} protected file: ${filepath}`)
  }

  // Check if file is large
  const lineCount = getLineCount(filepath)
  if (lineCount > 100) {
    return { requiresConfirmation: true }
  }

  return { safe: true }
}
```

## Recommendations

### For Future Agent Development

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**
   - Agents should only have permissions needed for their specific task
   - File modification should be opt-in, not default

2. **Explicit > Implicit**
   - Don't assume file relationships based on names
   - Require explicit file lists for bulk operations

3. **Audit Trail**
   - Log every file operation with reasoning
   - Make it easy to trace "why did the agent do that?"

4. **Reversibility**
   - All operations should be reversible
   - Consider implementing agent "undo" functionality

5. **Human-in-the-Loop**
   - For critical operations, always confirm with user
   - Provide preview of changes before execution

## Conclusion

### Summary

The API key remediation agent successfully completed its primary mission of finding and removing the revoked OpenAI API key. However, an overly aggressive file deletion strategy resulted in unintended data loss of critical planning documents.

**Key Takeaways**:
- ‚úÖ Agent worked as designed for primary task
- ‚ùå Lacked safeguards for protecting critical files
- ‚úÖ Git version control prevented permanent data loss
- ‚úÖ Rapid detection and recovery minimized impact
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive post-mortem created valuable lessons

### Final Status

**Incident**: RESOLVED
**Data Loss**: 0% (fully recovered)
**Time to Resolution**: 2 hours
**Prevention**: Action items created

**Overall Assessment**: This incident highlighted the importance of agent safety mechanisms while demonstrating the value of robust version control and rapid response protocols. The lessons learned will significantly improve future agent implementations.
