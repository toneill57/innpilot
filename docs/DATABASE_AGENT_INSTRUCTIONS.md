## Database Architecture Knowledge

### Current Schema Structure
```
PostgreSQL Database (Supabase):
├── public/
│   ├── sire_content (compliance data, shared)
│   ├── muva_content (tourism data, shared)
│   ├── tenant_registry (tenant metadata)
│   └── user_tenant_permissions (access control)
└── hotels/
    ├── accommodation_units (tenant_id filtering)
    ├── policies (tenant_id filtering)
    ├── client_info (tenant_id filtering)
    ├── properties (tenant_id filtering)
    ├── guest_information (tenant_id filtering)
    ├── unit_amenities (tenant_id filtering)
    ├── pricing_rules (tenant_id filtering)
    └── content (tenant_id filtering)
```

### Key Technical Specifications
- **Vector Dimensions**: 3072 (text-embedding-3-large)
- **Tenant Separation**: `tenant_id VARCHAR(50)` field
- **Search Threshold**: 0.3 (production optimized)
- **Index Strategy**: ivfflat for vector columns
- **Current Tenants**: SimmerDown (tenant_id='simmerdown')

### Critical Functions
1. `match_hotels_documents()` - Multi-tenant hotel search
2. `match_sire_documents()` - SIRE compliance search
3. `match_muva_documents()` - Tourism data search

## Operational Guidelines

### SAFE Operations (Execute Freely)

#### Health Checks
```sql
-- Vector search health validation
SELECT
  COUNT(*) as total_embeddings,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN embedding IS NOT NULL THEN 1 END) as valid_embeddings,
  AVG(array_length(embedding::real[], 1)) as avg_dimensions
FROM hotels.accommodation_units;
```

#### Monitoring Queries
```sql
-- Tenant data growth monitoring
SELECT
  tenant_id,
  COUNT(*) as record_count,
  MAX(created_at) as last_activity
FROM hotels.accommodation_units
GROUP BY tenant_id;

-- Index usage statistics
SELECT
  schemaname, tablename, indexname,
  idx_scan, idx_tup_read, idx_tup_fetch
FROM pg_stat_user_indexes
WHERE schemaname IN ('public', 'hotels');
```

#### Performance Analysis
```sql
-- Table size monitoring
SELECT
  schemaname, tablename,
  pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename)) as size
FROM pg_tables
WHERE schemaname IN ('public', 'hotels')
ORDER BY pg_total_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename) DESC;
```

### CONTROLLED Operations (Require Validation)

#### Index Management
```sql
-- Recreate vector indexes (safe, improves performance)
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_hotels_accommodation_units_embedding;
CREATE INDEX idx_hotels_accommodation_units_embedding
ON hotels.accommodation_units USING ivfflat (embedding vector_cosine_ops)
WITH (lists = 100);

-- Always run ANALYZE after index operations
ANALYZE hotels.accommodation_units;
```

#### Data Validation
```sql
-- Chunk consistency check
SELECT
  tenant_id, unit_code, total_chunks,
  COUNT(*) as actual_chunks,
  CASE WHEN total_chunks = COUNT(*) THEN 'OK' ELSE 'INCONSISTENT' END
FROM hotels.accommodation_units
WHERE unit_code IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY tenant_id, unit_code, total_chunks
HAVING total_chunks != COUNT(*);
```

### RESTRICTED Operations (Require Human Approval)

#### Schema Modifications
- Creating or dropping tables
- Altering table structures
- Adding or removing constraints
- Modifying column types

#### Data Migrations
- Moving data between schemas
- Bulk data updates or deletions
- Tenant data operations affecting >100 records
- Cross-tenant data operations

#### Permission Changes
- Schema permission modifications
- User access level changes
- Function permission updates

## Decision Trees

### When to Execute Index Recreation
```
Is search performance degraded?
├── YES: Check index usage stats
│   ├── Low idx_scan count → Recreation needed
│   └── High idx_scan count → Investigate queries
└── NO: Continue monitoring
```

### When to Alert for Manual Intervention
```
Vector embedding health check fails?
├── >5% NULL embeddings → ALERT: Data integrity issue
├── Dimensions != 3072 → ALERT: Vector dimension mismatch
├── Chunk inconsistency detected → ALERT: Document processing issue
└── All OK → Continue routine monitoring
```

### Tenant Onboarding Decision
```
New tenant request received?
├── Validate tenant_id uniqueness
├── Create property record
├── Set up user permissions
├── Test search function with tenant filter
└── Confirm isolation from other tenants
```

## Automated Procedures

### Daily Health Check
```sql
-- Execute this daily and alert on failures
WITH health_metrics AS (
  SELECT
    'hotels.accommodation_units' as table_name,
    COUNT(*) as total_records,
    COUNT(embedding) as valid_embeddings,
    COUNT(DISTINCT tenant_id) as active_tenants,
    AVG(array_length(embedding::real[], 1)) as avg_dimensions
  FROM hotels.accommodation_units

  UNION ALL

  SELECT
    'public.sire_content' as table_name,
    COUNT(*) as total_records,
    COUNT(embedding) as valid_embeddings,
    1 as active_tenants,
    AVG(array_length(embedding::real[], 1)) as avg_dimensions
  FROM public.sire_content
)
SELECT
  table_name,
  total_records,
  valid_embeddings,
  total_records - valid_embeddings as null_embeddings,
  ROUND(avg_dimensions) as dimensions,
  CASE
    WHEN valid_embeddings::float / total_records < 0.95 THEN 'UNHEALTHY'
    WHEN avg_dimensions != 3072 THEN 'DIMENSION_MISMATCH'
    ELSE 'HEALTHY'
  END as status
FROM health_metrics;
```

### Weekly Performance Review
```sql
-- Execute weekly for performance trending
SELECT
  schemaname, tablename,
  pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename)) as current_size,
  (SELECT pg_size_pretty(pg_database_size(current_database()))) as total_db_size
FROM pg_tables
WHERE schemaname IN ('public', 'hotels')
ORDER BY pg_total_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename) DESC;
```

## Error Handling Procedures

### Vector Dimension Mismatch
```sql
-- Diagnostic query
SELECT
  table_name,
  COUNT(*) as total_records,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN array_length(embedding::real[], 1) = 3072 THEN 1 END) as correct_dims,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN array_length(embedding::real[], 1) != 3072 THEN 1 END) as incorrect_dims
FROM (
  SELECT 'hotels.accommodation_units' as table_name, embedding FROM hotels.accommodation_units
  UNION ALL
  SELECT 'public.sire_content' as table_name, embedding FROM public.sire_content
) as combined
GROUP BY table_name;

-- ALERT if incorrect_dims > 0
```

### Search Function Failure
```sql
-- Test all search functions
SELECT 'match_hotels_documents' as function_name,
  CASE WHEN COUNT(*) > 0 THEN 'OK' ELSE 'FAILED' END as status
FROM match_hotels_documents(
  (SELECT embedding FROM hotels.accommodation_units LIMIT 1),
  'simmerdown', 'hotel', 0.3, 1
);

-- ALERT if any function returns FAILED
```

### Tenant Isolation Breach
```sql
-- Verify tenant data isolation
SELECT
  tenant_id,
  COUNT(*) as record_count,
  STRING_AGG(DISTINCT source_file, ', ') as files
FROM hotels.accommodation_units
GROUP BY tenant_id;

-- ALERT if unexpected tenant_id values appear
-- ALERT if cross-tenant file references detected
```

## Migration Assistance Protocols

### Pre-Migration Validation Checklist
- [ ] Backup current state
- [ ] Validate source data integrity
- [ ] Test migration on development copy
- [ ] Confirm rollback procedure
- [ ] Document expected outcome

### Migration Execution Pattern
1. **Pre-flight Check**: Validate source and target states
2. **Execute Migration**: Run validated migration scripts
3. **Immediate Validation**: Verify data integrity
4. **Function Testing**: Test all search functions
5. **Performance Check**: Confirm performance maintains baseline
6. **Sign-off**: Document successful completion

### Post-Migration Validation
```sql
-- Standard post-migration validation
SELECT
  'DATA_INTEGRITY' as check_type,
  CASE WHEN source_count = target_count THEN 'PASS' ELSE 'FAIL' END as result,
  source_count, target_count
FROM (
  SELECT
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM source_table) as source_count,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM target_table WHERE tenant_id = 'expected_tenant') as target_count
) as counts;
```

## Escalation Triggers

### Immediate Human Intervention Required
- Data loss detected (record count decreases unexpectedly)
- Vector dimension corruption across multiple tables
- Cross-tenant data contamination
- Search function failures affecting production
- Performance degradation >50% from baseline

### Schedule Human Review
- Consistent increase in NULL embeddings
- Unusual tenant data growth patterns
- Index performance degradation
- Schema evolution requirements

### Automatic Resolution Possible
- Single vector index corruption
- Minor chunk inconsistencies
- Performance optimization opportunities
- Routine maintenance tasks

## Security Constraints

### Data Access Limitations
- **NEVER** expose tenant data across tenant boundaries
- **ALWAYS** filter by tenant_id in multi-tenant queries
- **VERIFY** user permissions before any data operation
- **LOG** all administrative actions for audit

### Schema Modification Restrictions
- **REQUIRE** human approval for structural changes
- **VALIDATE** all migrations on test environment first
- **MAINTAIN** backward compatibility during transitions
- **DOCUMENT** all schema evolution decisions

### Function Management Rules
- **TEST** function changes in isolation
- **PRESERVE** existing function signatures during updates
- **VALIDATE** search result quality after function changes
- **MONITOR** performance impact of function modifications

## Performance Baselines

### Expected Response Times
- Vector search queries: <100ms for 4 results
- Health check queries: <50ms
- Data validation queries: <200ms
- Index recreation: <1 minute for tables <1000 records

### Resource Usage Thresholds
- Database connections: <80% of max_connections
